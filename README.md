Leetcode Problem
=======

This book is used to **record my understanding on solving the problem of LeetCode**. I will divide this book into serveral parts and each part have be an independent topic, just like the tag of the problem in Leetcode.



## Content

For the content of this book, you can refer to [here](./docs/content.md).



## Get started

There are two parts here, code and documents.



### Code parts

You can clone this repo to your linux local environment use the below instruction:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/wangdefa/Leetcode.git
```

Then you can go the directory of the ./src/build and run:

```shell
cmake ../
make -j8
```

Then all the executable file will be under the build directory.

```shell
$ tree 0_BasicDataStructure/
0_BasicDataStructure/
├── DivideConquer
├── HashTable
├── Heap
├── HuffmanTree
├── Knapsack
├── LinkedList
├── PriorityQueue
├── Queue
├── Random
├── Sort
├── Stack
└── Tree
0 directories, 12 files
$ ./0_BasicDataStructure/Random 
5	9	2	6	4	7	1	3	8	
```



### Document parts

Since the poor performance of supporting latex on github, I have given up looking for a better solution for this. But if you are still insterested in the document  itself, I recommand you install a $\textcolor{red}{markdown \, editor}$ named [typora](https://www.typora.io/)， it really a good assistant.

After you have install this tool, you can convert this document to HTML, PDF etc...
