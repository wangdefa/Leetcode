#### Document parts

Since the poor performance of supporting latex on github, I have given up looking for a better solution for this. But if you are still insterested in the document  itself, I recommand you install a markdown editor named [typora](https://www.typora.io/)， it really a good assistant.

After you have install this tool, you can convert this document to HTML, PDF etc...
